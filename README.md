# Show-Quarantine
Create an Outlook add-in that shows the user's quarantine folder in a web browser

Summary
Open https://security.microsoft.com/quarantine in default browser from an add-in button in the Outlook ribbon.

Got the idea and most of the code from here:
https://blog.expta.com/2021/10/how-to-install-outlook-add-in-to-view.html

Unfortunately this isn't working in my case in folders with preview pane off.
Installation to clients via EAC for Exchange online is accepted w/o error messages,
but the add-in does not arrive at the clients.
